This project analyzes survey data focusing on user demographics, satisfaction, and preferred online platforms. The dataset includes fields such as Age Group, Gender, Satisfaction Score (1-5), and Platform Preferred. After loading the data using pandas, initial visualizations were created to understand user preferences and distributions.

A bar chart was generated using Seaborn to visualize how many respondents preferred platforms like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. This chart made it clear which platforms are most popular among the surveyed users. A pie chart followed to show the gender distribution, offering a clear visual of the male, female, and other gender proportions in the survey sample.

To examine how age affects user satisfaction, a heatmap was created using a crosstab of Age Group versus Satisfaction Score. This provided insights into which age groups were more satisfied or dissatisfied overall. Additionally, an interactive bar chart was created using Plotly to show platform preferences broken down by gender, adding a more dynamic and gender-specific analysis of social media usage.

Together, these visualizations offered a clear understanding of demographic trends, satisfaction levels, and platform preferences among users, which can guide future marketing or product strategies.
