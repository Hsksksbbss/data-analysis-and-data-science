This code performs an analysis of an e-commerce dataset using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. It begins by loading the dataset and converting order dates into datetime format. Missing values in the review_score column are filled with the average score to ensure clean data. A new column is created to extract the hour from each order, which is later used to identify peak ordering hours through a line plot. The code also analyzes the top-selling products by summing up the quantity of each product ordered and visualizes this with a bar chart. User retention is calculated by checking how many users placed more than one order, but the result shows a 0% retention rate, meaning every user ordered only once. Lastly, the script calculates the average review score for each product and displays it using another bar chart to identify the best-rated items. Overall, the analysis provides insights into product popularity, customer behavior, and order timing.
