This project analyzes user behavior on Netflix using a dataset that includes information like watch date, genre, duration, and user ratings. The watch date is converted to datetime format to extract the month and day of the week, enabling time-based analysis. The most popular genres are identified by counting how often each genre appears, and the top 10 are visualized in a bar chart. The total watch duration per user is calculated, and the top 20 users by watch time are shown using a bar plot, giving insight into heavy users. To explore binge-watching behavior, the data is grouped by user and date to count the number of sessions per day. Users watching 3 or more shows per day are considered binge-watchers, and their session distribution is visualized in a histogram. The project also analyzes content quality by calculating the average rating per genre, displaying it with a horizontal bar chart. Finally, monthly watch trends are examined by summing total watch durations for each month, highlighting seasonal engagement patterns through a line plot. This analysis helps uncover key patterns in viewing habits, popular content types, and user engagement trends over time.
