In this project, a dataset containing student performance metrics such as subject marks, attendance percentage, and login frequency was analyzed to extract meaningful insights. After importing the data, any missing values were filled with zeros to ensure a clean dataset. A new column named "Average_Marks" was created by averaging marks across Math, Science, and English. Based on these averages, students were classified into three performance categories: Top (≥75%), Average (50–74.9%), and Struggling (<50%).

Correlations were then calculated to understand relationships between metrics. A moderate-to-strong positive correlation was found between attendance percentage and average marks, and similarly between weekly login frequency and performance, indicating consistent engagement supports academic success. Students with attendance below 70% showed significantly lower average scores, highlighting absenteeism as a major factor in underperformance
