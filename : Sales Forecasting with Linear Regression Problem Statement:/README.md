This project uses a sales dataset to analyze revenue trends and predict future sales using Linear Regression. The dataset includes columns like Date, Product, Quantity, and Revenue. The Date column is converted to datetime format, and numerical values are cleaned to ensure accuracy. A new time-based feature called days is created to represent the number of days since the start of the dataset. The sales data is grouped by day, summing the revenue to observe daily trends. Using this data, the model is trained to predict revenue based on the days feature. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, a Linear Regression model is fitted, and predictions are made. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance. A scatter plot is then used to visually compare actual vs predicted sales. The trained model is also used to forecast revenue for the next 30 days, and the predictions are shown in a tabular format. Finally, a smoothed line plot of revenue over time (using a 3-day rolling average) is displayed to visualize overall sales trends and identify any upward or downward patterns.
