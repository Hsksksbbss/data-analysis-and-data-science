This program performs customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a dataset containing customer attributes such as Age, Income, Frequency, and Spending. The data is first loaded from a CSV file using pandas, and the first few rows are displayed for a quick view. Before applying clustering, the features are standardized using StandardScaler from sklearn to ensure that each attribute contributes equally to the clustering algorithm. The K-Means algorithm is then applied with 4 clusters, and the resulting cluster labels are added to the DataFrame. To help understand the clustering results, the program visualizes the data in two ways: a 2D scatter plot using Seaborn (based on Income vs Spending) and a 3D scatter plot using Matplotlib (with Age, Income, and Spending as axes). These visualizations help to clearly see how customers are grouped into different clusters based on their spending behavior and demographics, which can be very useful for targeted marketing or business decision-making.
