This code analyzes traffic data to understand vehicle patterns and predict future traffic using machine learning. It starts by loading a dataset containing timestamps and vehicle counts, then extracts the hour and date from each timestamp. A line plot shows how traffic changes over time, while a bar chart reveals that the peak traffic hour is 6:00 AM with an average count of 59.2 vehicles. Next, a linear regression model is used to predict future traffic based on time, achieving a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 618.16. Finally, the code checks for traffic anomalies—extreme vehicle counts outside normal range—but none are found in this dataset. Overall, the project provides insights into traffic patterns and builds a simple prediction model.
